to an external Mailing List Manager in both text and html formats.  It is
capable of sending messages out immediately, at predefined intervals such as
daily/weekly/monthly or manually.

The text and HTML templates are completely customisable on a per feed basis
so you can tailor the emails to suit the list or feed you are using.

* Automatically kick off formatted emails to mailing list managers on blog feed update.
* Email notifications to one or more people on feed updates.
* Track your favourite blog feeds by email.

### Features:

* HTML + Text Emails
* Ability to include custom mail header fields
* Flexible send schedule including fifteen minute, daily, weekly, monthly or manual sending

== Installation ==
------------------
1.	Upload the /sendfeed/ folder and files to your WordPress plugins folder,
	located in your WordPress install under /wp-content/plugins/

2.	Browse in the WordPress admin interface to the plugin activation page and
	activate the SendFeed plugin.

3.	The plugin should now be installed and activated.  The first time you visit
	management page, the appropriate tables will be created in the database
	if necessary.

4.	You may create new contact forms by using the controls found on the
	Settings > SendFeed page.

5.	The email scheduling of SendFeed will function best on high traffic sites.
	If your site does not receive very much traffic, you may want to set up a
	cron script to load the wp-cron.php page from your site at regular 
	intervals.  Some information on doing this can be found here:
	http://www.satollo.net/how-to-make-the-wordpress-cron-work
	
	Cron example running every 15 minutes:
	*/15 * * * *	/usr/bin/php -f /path/to/your/site/wp-cron.php
	(You will want to test this on the commandline of your server to ensure it
	is working as expected) (You may also need to use /usr/bin/php-cgi instead, 
	depending on your server configuration)
	
	Alternative: Use a third party service like this one...
